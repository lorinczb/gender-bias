# Language embeddings debiasing

Given the growing concern about the negative impact that gender-biased language embeddings may have in practical applications, we measure the gender bias in existing Romanian language embeddings using the method proposed in [Examining Gender Bias in Languages with Grammatical Gender](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02224.pdf) for languages with grammatical gender, and invite contributors to submit debiasing methods that can lower the gender bias in existing embeddings, or submit less biased embeddings.

We include the Romanian embeddings, the list of feminine and masculine nouns, occupational words and definition words used for the experiments. The source code is adapted from [Bias in Gendered Languages](https://github.com/shaoxia57/Bias_in_Gendered_Languages)
